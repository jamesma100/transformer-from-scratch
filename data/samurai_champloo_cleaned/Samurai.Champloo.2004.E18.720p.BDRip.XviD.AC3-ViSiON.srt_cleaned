When one reflects on the past, regardless of culture, it is during periods of idleness that fashion is cultivated and born. Yes, even the threadbare casual style was born here during the Edo Era. And designs resembling street fashion had already arrived on the scene. I think I'll try cod roe and mochi cheese in mine. Coming right up! So, what are you guys getting? Seafood style. With oysters. You got it. And you, buddy? Gimme what this guy's having. Coming right up. You keep ordering the same thing as Jin or me. You can eat whatever you want, you know? I don't got much choice. But everything's written there on the menu, plain as day. That's my point. I can't understand it, okay? Are you telling me that you can't read? This one here is " no. " So's this one. And this one, too. See, I can read just fine. What's this one, then? You little bitch, that was a trick question! Are you telling me that you can only read one letter? Being able to read one is more than enough, you know? Now that you mention it, I've never seen you read anything before. I can get by just fine without being able to read. Isn't it amazing that in all the time we've been traveling together, we've never noticed that he can't read? Hey, you just laughed, didn't you?! Listen up, you don't need to be able to read to kill people. What's that crap you're spoutin', boy?! It's okay for a fool to stay a fool, huh? Don't give me that pathetic garbage! Listen good! Every word has a soul in it! If you don't know the letters that convey that soul, you're the one who loses out. When you're illiterate, you're automatically branded as an idiot! Don't that piss you off, boy?! Well?! Don't it?! Are you okay with bein' an idiot?! Are you?! He passed out... Let's see... How much do we owe? D'oh! We're short! Put it on this old dude's tab, okay? Don't sweat it. Call it a nuisance fee. Let's go. Sorry, mister! Mister? C'mon, wake up. Time to settle up. All together, it comes to 1 3 shu. What the hell is this?! We keep painting it over and over... It's a vicious circle. They're getting awfully cocky. Um, pardon me, ladies. Do you know who painted this? Of course we don't! If we did, we would've had 'em arrested ages ago! I-I see... I'm sorry, but there is someone over in Mihara to whom I am indebted, so I would like to stop by and pay my respects. Mihara's pretty far away from here. Who would you be willing to go that far to see? An old girlfriend? To anyone who aspires to mastery of the martial arts, Mihara is a town that cannot be passed by. Among all the town's dojos, the best one in which to study general weapons mastery... is Gojuu Hall. Under the tutelage of Master Junosuke Niwa, I once-- Fine, go have fun! And make sure you ask him if he knows anything about the sunflower samurai, okay? Hey, deep down, you really want to learn how to read, don't you? Just drop it. I'll teach you. Look, that's "sa, " and " n, " and " jou. " That means "was here. " Got it? That's the bastard who stiffed me yesterday... What the heck does 4-6-4-9 mean? Oh, it's "yoroshiku"! Huh? Who the hell are you? What do you think you're doing here? Sorry, pal, but this is our team's turf. Listen up, pops. I think we're gonna collect a little relaxation fee from you. He's telling you to hand over your money! This is a place where those who strive to master the martial arts gather together. This is no place for the likes of you to be loitering around. Sorry, mister. But the thing is, this is our hideout. Where might I find Master Niwa? Master Niwa? Oh, if you mean the bosses, they're in town right now. What? Darn that Mugen... He's always disappearing into thin air. Is that how you show your respect towards your elder brother?! You were only born one stinkin' minute before me, so don't pull that big brother crap! You think that a guy who can't keep junior and senior rankings straight is cut out to be the boss?! What do you think this is, some procession of feudal lords? That way of thinking is so behind the times! Just looking at that face of yours pisses me off. You took the words right outta my mouth. What're they talking about? Their faces are identical. Stop copying me! You' re the one who's copying me, you dick! Those big brown eyes are so cute! You're wrong! The way her mouth is a little coy is seriously sexy! Goodness. And that voice like a bell is so sweet! No way! The way her little nose is turned up just a little bit is so honey-bunny! Hey, you two! It's been a long time. Tatsunoshin. Kazunosuke. You know these two? That hurt! Just who the hell are you?! My name is Bundai. This here is a private school. And under this roof, you will address me as Sensei! You're a teacher? You can keep trying to solve all your problems by force the way you're doing now, but that won't stop the world from turning. You can't build a castle if all you've got is carpenters. What you need is a wood plane. And even if you've got wood planes, you'll get hurt if they aren't kept good and sharp at all times. First, you sharpen your plane. I'm about to teach you how to read. Doesn't it piss you off?! To have your companions mock you like that?! Are you kidding me?! You can't read?! All right, damn it, you're on! Why do you quarrel with one another? As brothers, should you not be helping one another and mastering the path that your father handed down to you? What do you expect? Nobody takes over as heads of families or follows in their father's footsteps these days. Hell, when somebody offs themselves, they're only screwing over the ones they're leaving behind. Besides, the way this guy dresses scares people. Come back and try saying that again after you've washed that filthy mug of yours! Say what?! You want some, pinhead? Enough of this. If this is the case, settle the matter with swords like true heirs of Gojuu Hall. In that case, what could act as a substitute for a sword for the two of you? Your graffiti? That's not quite right, bro. It might look like ordinary graffiti to you, but it's something that we've devoted our lives to. So in that sense, it's no different from the way Pop devoted himself to the sword. It's called tagging, and it's like it proves that we're alive. That ain't right. We try to tag the most dangerous places. Places that nobody else has ever tagged before. It's like the only time we're really alive is when we're experiencing that thrill. They're both saying pretty much the same thing, huh? Okay, then. You should duel each other using this tagging of yours. You could say that the winner will be the one who tags the most dangerous place, right? Oh, goodness... Whatever shall I do? What's this one? It's "re. " This one with the swoop on the end, that one's " re"! How many times do I gotta explain it?! This is so damn confusing! What's the matter, my good first grade pupil? Are you crying uncle? Are you? Are you gonna turn tail? The way all these letters look so much alike pisses me off! If you've got complaints to make, I'll listen to 'em after you've passed these drills! This is awfully unusual for you, isn't it? Acting as a mediator all of a sudden... I mean, this is just a simple brawl between brothers, right? Their father, the man I am indebted to, once asked something of me. There is now nothing more that I can teach you. Return to your master and walk our path with your head held high. Yes, sir. I have a favor to ask of you. If anything should ever happen to me, I ask that you look after my sons. Tag! This is a surprise... Do you remember me? It has been a long time, sir. My, what fine flowers you've placed there... They're just wild chrysanthemums that I found over there. No, it is the thought that counts. I'm sure that Master Niwa is smiling beyond the grave. What was it that happened? Of all the earthly emotions of men, jealousy may be the most powerful. There was no dojo in the area that surpassed Gojuu Hall. The masters of the other dojos curried favor with the local lord and made false accusations against Master Niwa. He was ordered to either close his doors and take down his sign or cut off his own arm. And so, in order to leave the dojo to his sons, he committed ritual suicide. But his young sons were unable to appreciate their father's strength and learn from his example. With the way those two are behaving, his memory will never be respected. All questions answered correctly! Damn straight. What else did you expect? And now, use the letters you've learned to write your own story! Write it bigger than anybody else! Hey, where the heck have you been?! Oh, around... Geez, we've got a serious situation here! Two men who are vying for my attention are fighting each other at this very minute. Sounds rough, all right. Um... I think they called it jogging or something. It's a life-or-death struggle using letters! Letters, you say? Stop! Police! What the hell is this? This is terrible! Somebody, help! The reds... The blues... How lovely. I got you beat! You wish! No, you wish! The duel will never be settled at this rate. Well, is there anywhere that you haven't put graffiti on yet? Well... Yeah, there's one. Hold it! Come along peacefully! They're getting revenge in their own way. The revenge against the lord that their father was unable to get himself. It's wrong! They should be ashamed! I know what you mean. Kids these days don't have any respect. You're writing it wrong! Magnificent...! This is what I've been looking for! Who the hell is that?! Come back here! I'm number one! So, who won the duel? Neither one of us. Somebody beat us to it. We got beat by some mystery man. It's a big world. There's always somebody better than you. What is important is that you have learned that lesson. Then I guess nobody wins me, either. Huh? Hey, now! She's so cute! Awesome! Just look at those round eyes! I recognize your talent for what it is! You must be the tagging team that has this town all abuzz. What if we are? Who are you people? How delightfully cool! Boys, I will make you famous! You boys have it in you to become designers who will breathe fresh air into this stagnant industry! I just know it! So, who are you? The textile merchant who is known to all in Ura-Edo. I am Uhori from the Ando Store. A pleasure, I'm sure. Nothing doing. Before that, you do have something else to see to! You've been writing everything wrong! You're gonna hit the books first! Got it?! Are you serious?! Come back! What's the matter? This one! And this one, too! What's going on here?! Hey, you jerk! What's the meaning of this? You gotta write your name on your stuff, you know? That symbol-- Wait, don't tell me that the man last night was-- Later, when the two young men traveled to Edo, they blew a breath of fresh air into the fashion world, and their designs spread from Ura-Edo Avenue to all across the country. And people came to call these two men "The Embodiment of Graffiti. " To be continued! Dawn comes, and we part ways once again My dreams becoming distant apparitions I turn to the warm wind for help, the wind I felt every time you held me As I was bathed in the light that followed on your heels Spring is announced when the wild plants break out in a dance Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields are patterns of grass set out to dry The autumn moon rises, let's celebrate its fullness Winter passes by, and I count off the days and months again I can still see the too-distant blue sky when I close my eyes (It was so warm) As I reminisce, I take your hand as I pluck flowers and sing Within the memories that are now coming back to me I'm setting out to find my way back to you Spring is announced when the mountain leaves break out in dance Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with plains grass patterns are set out to dry The autumn moon rises, let's celebrate its fullness Winter passes by, and I count off the days and months again Dawn comes, and we part ways once again My dreams becoming distant apparitions I turn to the warm wind for help, the wind I felt every time you held me As I was bathed in the light that followed on your heels
