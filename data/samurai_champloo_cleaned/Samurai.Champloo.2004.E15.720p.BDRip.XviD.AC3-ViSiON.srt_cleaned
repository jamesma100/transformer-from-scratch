Our three travelers, Mugen, Jin, and Fuu, continue their long journey to distant Nagasaki. After they set out from Edo, they passed through the Hakone Checkpoint. they passed Suruga, they passed Hamamatsu, they passed Ise, and in spite of various digressions, have traveled ever westward. And now, overcoming many trials and tribulations, they arrived at long last at the Kamigata area. In other words, Samurai Champloo has now begun its Kansai chapter. We hope you enjoy it! Pike in Kansai " These freshwater fish taste a lot better than I thought. There's a book called Master of the River that says they taste bad, though. Well, I guess they do have a lot of bones... Jin! Just give up, already! C'mon over here and join us for lunch! I'll share my catch with you! Aw, forget him. He's just being stubborn 'cause he came up empty. Yeah, but still... C'mon, before we started fishing, he said, struggle between man and fish. Approach it lightly, and you are certain to be hurt. " He actually said that, and the moron can't even catch fish that're swimming right in front of him! W-We shouldn't laugh at him! It's not nice! Um, do you think we might have overdone it a little? Don't look him in the eye, got it? W-Where the heck did you get these?! They were lying at the bottom of the pond. This means we're a filthy bitch. That's filthy rich! I hope you're doing that deliberately. Well, whatever the case may be... Banzai! A city! Proper food! Boy, I'm stuffed... For the first time in ages, I'm actually full. She's some kinda low-grade monster... I'm so full and it's no bull! ? it's no bull that I'm so full! ? I can eat everything you got! ? Hey, you guys! Where do you think you're going?! Hey! No women allowed! What? How come? This is the red light district! No way! Darn it, let go of me! You two traitors! You jerks! Welcome, my good sirs! Please, right this way! Word on the street is that this is the best place in town. Well, I must say that our girls' looks and skills are the equal of any Edo geisha. We like to think of ourselves as the finest establishment in the West. We have nothing but the best girls. There's not a bad one in the bunch! And our prices are most reasonable. Our guests have nothing to complain about. Now, sirs, please make yourselves at home in this room for a few moments. I will go make arrangements for food and courtesans that are in keeping with your price range. I can't believe those two jerks... How could they go to a red light district when they've got me around? It sure is tough to be a girl, isn't it? Hey, are you a boy, Momo? Or a girl? I'm so hungry... Welcome, good sirs! My name is Takigawa. My name is Seyama. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Yatsuha. It is a pleasure to meet you. Sweet! Okay, I'm gonna take this girl here. The rest of you ladies, have fun with four-eyes here. What do you think, sir? Who are they? We are unsure of their identities, but they seem to be a pair of ronin. And they entered the city today? So it would seem. These are the coins that we'd planned to release in Kaga three days from now. Why are they circulating already? Did you fail in your duties, Kakizou? Yes, sir. I can offer no excuses. I will submit myself for punishment later. I am putting together a report as quickly as possible. Bring him up! Who is this? A man by the name of Hankichi Otowa who tried to escape from the underground foundry the other day. We captured him near Ryugakubo, but he had nothing on him at the time. However... However? Just to be safe, we put him under intense torture, but he never said a word. It's possible that he's been trained to withstand torture. I can't believe it... Are you saying we've been infiltrated by the Shogunate's secret police? This is serious... Kakinoji! Who else started here at the same time as this laborer? At the same period, sir? This man started working at the foundry about a year ago. There were four or five others who started working underground at that time. As for workers who started aboveground a year ago, Yatsuha is the only one I can think of. I can't believe that Yatsuha could be-- Whether or not you believe it is irrelevant. Doubts are like flies, they must all be crushed. For the sake of our great cause, we must be thorough in all things. There can be no exceptions. I'll leave the disposal of those two ronin to you, Kakizou. Turn them into fish food so as not to raise any suspicions. There was apparently a fat girl who was accompanying the two men. Her, too. Track her down and eliminate her. Yes, sir! Don't leave any traces whatsoever. I'm counting on you. This isn't good... Whatcha doin', baby? Oh, nothing in particular... I don't like being teased. So, what say we let the good times roll, huh? I'm paying good money for you, after all. You have a point... I'm sorry about that, but it looks like the situation has changed. It looks like my partner has been captured. I think I'm in danger, too. I have to go back to Edo and come up with a new plan. Boy, this is so irritating... I've been working an undercover investigation here for a whole year, and now this. See you around, loverboy. If it's in the cards, maybe we'll meet again. Damn, that hurt... You know, I think I could get into this rough stuff. H-Hey, wait a minute! I'm not lettin' you get away again. Oh, good grief... Now, then... Let's get down to business. Oh! Look over there! It's a naked woman! This guy is incredibly tough... But still... Tough chicks totally turn me on... Hey, would you like to do something really fun with me? Then let's go to the room next door. No, who the hell are you? Oh, gosh! There are people here already! We can't do anything really fun with these guys in here! You sons of bitches...! Beat it! Hankichi, are you all right? Are you alive? Yatsuha, is that you...? I'm sorry, I couldn't outrun them... These people are no ordinary forgers... I can't believe that someone as fast as you couldn't get away... Who are they? Probably remnants of the Negoro... The Negoro militant monks? The mercenaries from the Warring States period? You're telling me that they're still around? We don't have enough men... Yatsuha, go to our master for reinforcements... It'll be all right. I'll take it from here. I'll try to come up with something. I'm sorry... Now, where were we? Oh, we can't do anything really fun in a room like this! Hey, I know! As I recall, there's another great spot right below this room! Is this all of them? Yes, sir. The other one bit off his own tongue and killed himself. As I expected. I'll have you sing a little for me. About who sent you. What's going on?! Hey. Hey, what the hell is going on? Looks like our timing was a little too good. Who are you? So, you're the big boss of the operation, huh? I've finally seen your face. A spy from the East, huh? Ginsa Momochi! All of your misdeeds have been exposed! Counterfeiting the koban coins of the realm is the most serious of all serious crimes! This counterfeiting foundry is irrefutable proof! Surrender yourself and come along peacefully! What's so funny?! And just who have my crimes been exposed to? Only you two? We are the 20-odd descendants of the Tsuda clan of Negoro. The clan's mighty warriors are gathered here. Outnumbered here by the likes of us, what can mere secret policemen who serve in a country at peace hope to accomplish? You have us outnumbered, all right... Hey, if you take out all of these guys for me, I'll do something really amazing with you. Are you kidding me? I'm not falling for that again. You're on! Get them! Excuse me, miss. Have you seen a really fat girl who's about your age around here? Nope. Sorry to bother you. Okay, let's check over there! Yes, sir! Damn, you're persistent! Who's out there? Answer one question. Where did you get the koban? As I suspected, that money has a history... I'm under no obligation to answer you. My back... Master Jin...! This can't be... How did you-- Who are you?! The daughter of Shogunate secret service officer, Jinpachi of Iga! Yatsuha! Now I see... You're Jinpachi's daughter. Imagine, the revival of the Tsuda clan being thwarted by a blood relative of the same clan of ninja mercenaries that brought us down... Well, no matter. Thank you. For the past year, we were hiding here and secretly investigating these guys, and we were finally able to arrest them. We owe it all to you. That's okay, I don't need no thanks. That is, just so long as you keep your promise...! Look! A naked woman! Yatsuha, are you sure he's gonna be okay if we leave him here like this? It looked like he had traveling companions. They'll probably come looking for him. Come on, let's get moving. It's a long way to Edo. I just hope the crows don't eat him first. He'll be fine. He's not that delicate. After all, that's the man who's gonna be my husband. I'm in love! Bye-bye. Once both our journeys are over, I'll come find you. A-Are you serious? I'm starving to death! My back... Dawn comes, and we part ways once again My dreams becoming distant apparitions I turn to the warm wind for help, the wind I felt every time you held me As I was bathed in the light that followed on your heels Spring is announced when the wild plants break out in a dance Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields are patterns of grass set out to dry The autumn moon rises, let's celebrate its fullness Winter passes by, and I count off the days and months again I can still see the too-distant blue sky when I close my eyes (It was so warm) As I reminisce, I take your hand as I pluck flowers and sing Within the memories that are now coming back to me I'm setting out to find my way back to you Spring is announced when the mountain leaves break out in dance Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with plains grass patterns are set out to dry The autumn moon rises, let's celebrate its fullness Winter passes by, and I count off the days and months again Dawn comes, and we part ways once again My dreams becoming distant apparitions I turn to the warm wind for help, the wind I felt every time you held me As I was bathed in the light that followed on your heels
