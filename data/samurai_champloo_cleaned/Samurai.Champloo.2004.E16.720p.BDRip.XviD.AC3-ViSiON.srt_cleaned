I never met anybody like him before. I know he 's still alive. Something in my gut says he is. Isn't there an easier road to take? It's not like we're making the Kumano pilgrimage or anything. Isn't there a shortcut or something that'll get us to the west faster? I'm not familiar with the West. More to the point, what's up with that? It'll be the same no matter which road we take. Anyway, when we're mixed in with a crowd like this, if any idiots are after us, they won't spot us, right? What, are you guys criminals or something? Yep, that's right. I've been a criminal since the day I was born. You think it might be because I'm so good lookin'? He's an idiot. He's just your average idiot. So, ladies... Wanna go over there where the grass is nice 'n tall? What did you have in mind? All sorts of things. He's a perv! Your average perv! But they say that there's a dangerous monster here deep in the mountains. A monster? What did they say it was? A Tengu? A Kappa? No, a crow monster, remember? The kind with lots of legs. Oh, don't let that kinda talk scare you. Rumors like that always start with somebody mistaking a bear or something for a monster. And as the rumor spreads from one person to the next, it gets more and distorted, and before you know it, it's a monster. Hey, what're you doing?! Cut it out! Jerk! Pervert! Sleazeball! Ow... His libido plays second fiddle to his stomach, I guess. That monster's gotta be Yoshitsune. Yo! He haunts it, haunts it, haunts it, haunts this mountain! This mountain's haunted by Yoshitsune's... It's gotta be his ghost! He's the cat who was famous throughout the land, What makes him badder is that he was quick as an adder, leaping here and there! And they say that as a handsome man, his looks were unmatched in all the land! They seem to be mixing up different rumors. Y'know? So what is it that's in these mountains? Rumors. Nothing but rumors. Gotta take a leak... Gotta take a leak... Well, it definitely don't look like we're dealin' with a Tengu or a Kappa here... Hey, are you sure this is a shortcut? C'mon, what made you decide to go this way? Cause it looks like there really is something living here. There's something in these mountains. Of course there are things living here. So what's your point? It sounds interesting. Am I right? Learning the truth behind this does have my interest piqued. That you two are totally incapable of following the scent of sunflowers. All you're interested in is being with a cute girl like me. You aren't the least bit interested in trying to find the sunflower samurai anymore! I hate it when people get the wrong impression about me. You don't think I'm interested in looking for your sunflower samurai anymore? Well, I gotta tell you... I never was interested! And as for wanting to be with you, I never gave that a second thought, either! I never gave it a first thought! You think you're cute, huh? Not bloody likely! Why have you stayed with me all this time, then?! It just worked out that way! Pure chance! Stop this. It's unseemly. Even this silent poindexter was thinking the same thing. Hanging around this girl who's got zero sex appeal is no fun at all. That last remark went too far. Yeah, you tell him! I can't overlook that A samurai who smells of sunflowers? What's up with that? Why do you wanna find a pansy like that, anyway? He's not like that! What's he like, then?! W-Well, he's... See what I mean? You don't know anything about him, either. Don't tell me that you don't even know what he looks like... How come you're so desperate to find this guy when you don't even know for sure if he's alive or dead? He's alive! Until I find him and beat him up, he's gonna stay alive no matter what. This is about revenge? What's it matter to you? I bet this guy raped you and threw you away like garbage, and now you're out for revenge, right? Oh, okay. Now I get it. It's all clear to me now! Listen, you two are nothing more than hired muscle, so I'm gonna trade up to tougher models! I'm trading up! Gimme a break! A loudmouthed little girl like you ain't gonna fire me! I quit! Your services are no longer required. Goodbye. That's a load off my mind! See ya! Hey...! You retarded coward! You closet pervert halfwit! Those two are-- Screw it. See if I care! Momo? Come down! Hey, wait! I don't want you to leave me, too! Momo? Don't! Stay off me! Aw, man! This is bad! I forgot to kill that bastard before I left! Crap... This woulda been my perfect chance, too. Bastard! What's the big idea?! Bastard... Do you work for Matsumae domain? Where the hell is that? And who the hell are you?! You got the wrong guy! Apologize, dammit! I can't hold on... As I suspected. I see that your skills have improved, Yukimaru. So, even you have come after me for revenge? When Ogura was unable to carry out his plan, he took his own life. But I'm not like those others from the dojo. There's no point in avenging our master's death. With the dojo gone now, all everyone talks about is you. I'm sick of it. You wish to make a name for yourself? When you killed our master, that's exactly what you did. Why do you keep running away?! I have no desire to kill you. You aren't good enough to kill me! You aren't worth killing. If I killed you, it would only tarnish my sword. I won't always be the same little boy I used to be! Your time in the sun is over! What's the matter? Shall we continue and go to Hell together? Say that you killed me if you like. I might as well be dead already. This is bad... I'm gonna die... I'm actually gonna die... Please, help me... Somebody, please help me... Why, you! Momo! Um... You were carried here by the river. I was? Does my appearance seem so strange to you? No, it's not that. I just... Really, can I? Don't mind if I do! Yum, this is so good! A woman with a healthy appetite is a beautiful one. You've done so much to help me... But I can't do anything to repay you. Momo, come here. What's with you? I think it's because I have these. Sunflower seeds... Geez, you're such a little mercenary... Well, thank you for everything. Ow, that hurts... Um, what're you-- These medicinal herbs are good for wounds. Leave them there for a while, and it will feel better. Thank you. The forest is dangerous at night. Feel free to sleep here tonight. Um... My name is Fuu. What's yours? What's your name? My name is Okuru. Is this your home? For the time being. I'm on a journey. You've traveled alone the whole time? Yes. I'm all alone, too. Those two jerks are gone now. Those jerks? Yeah. I used to have a couple of useless bodyguards who were traveling with me. Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. Now I don't have anyone in the whole world. That's why it doesn't matter if I wind up dead in a ditch somewhere. But I always hated the thought of drowning. I mean, you can bloat up to twice your size, right? Forget that! I wanna leave a beautiful corpse when I die. In my old village, everyone was taken by the Roaming God. It's an infectious disease. Everyone in the village... They all died of it. I was away on a journey, so I alone survived. My wife and infant daughter were taken by the gods, as well. Oh... Death leaves behind no beautiful corpses. None. Good riddance to those two. Damn straight. That little bitch... Where will you go from here? I have simply been heading westwards. Westward... I can't stay here for much longer. I'm heading to the West, too. To Nagasaki. I'm looking for a samurai who smells of sunflowers. Um... Would it be okay if I went with you, Okuru? Quit sneaking around out there. C'mon out. I'll take you on whenever you're ready. We 're police officers with the Matsumae domain magistrate's office! Come along peacefully, Okuru! Give yourself up!
