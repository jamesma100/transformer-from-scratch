I'm sorry, I need to borrow your awning for a while. You're a traveler, right? Please, come in. Um... The thing is, I don't have any-- That's all right, don't worry about the money. We love to hear travelers tell stories about unfamiliar places here. You don't need to stand on ceremony with us. Okay, if you insist. Many thanks. Pops, give us some sake, potatoes, and some oden stew. I'm really sorry. That song makes me cry no matter how many times I hear it. There is something that I've heard. They say that the songs of a goze are so sad because they show the listener things that he cannot see. Goze? A blind, traveling performer. Come on, Mugen, he may have said to help ourselves, but try showing some restraint. I don't know the meaning of the word. Well done. Um... Your song was really great. That song was a real downer. It's a waste to see a fine lady like you singing stuff like that. Hey, watch it! Have one on me. I don't accept handouts from anyone. I like your style. That song made us cry like babies! The thing is, did you know that this area's our turf, lady? We can't have a wandering goze set up shop here without our permission. Come on, say something! Even if your eyes don't work, your mouth oughta work just fine, moron! Hey, leave her alone! You got a problem? It's all right. I don't want anyone's sympathy just because I'm blind. Say what? Sounds like she isn't taking us seriously. Hey, do you want us to break your hand so you'll never be able to play the shamisen again? Ow! Do you want me to smash this mouth of yours so you'll never be able to pick a fight again? Bastard! You forgot this! Geez, those guys didn't put up a fight at all. Excuse me... Now, now. That wasn't sympathy, I have ulterior motives. What's your name? My name is Sara. I like you, lady. I like your face. Your aggressiveness, too. Ow...! So, the three of you have been traveling together all this way? Well, it kinda worked out that way. Where are you headed? I'm going to Hyuga, which is a little to the south of here. Excuse me, Fuu? I'm sorry for what I said. You were only trying to be kind, and I lashed out at you. Oh, that? I've been on my own for a long time, so I've become a little sensitive and stubborn. That's okay, I don't mind. If it's all right with you, would you like to join me until I reach Hyuga? I'd like to repay you for your kindness. I'll pay for our room and board. in the forests of Shinoda. ? sitting and listening for so long... ? Geez, you two! Taking advantage of someone's kind offer is one thing, but this is ridiculous! Well, I guess this is a lot better than the times when we fought tooth and nail over a single dumpling. Forgive me if I'm speaking out of turn, but isn't that a Kishibojin charm? Hey, that's right! I've been wondering about that, too. Do you have a child? Yes. No, my child is still alive. So, is it with its father now? The father is no longer around. But then-- If a woman is blind, she isn't fit to be a mother. It's ironic, isn't it? A woman like that singing a song like " Kuzunoha Leaves her Child. " Are we clear on this? We have Sara to thank for being able to stay here. So don't get any funny ideas, got it? Yes, ma'am... We're in this one. You two use that one. Mugen? This isn't any fun. You can't see me, so you don't even let out a little scream. How'd you know it was me? Everyone has his own individual aura about him. I can sense that. I've walked in darkness for a long time. But people can grow accustomed to anything. Even if you can't see, you become able to sense other things. So I don't want you to feel sorry for me. That's a load of crap. Nobody who's happy could sing that song of yours. What do you think you're doing?! I'm just taking a bath, that's all! You're fooling around with Sara, aren't you?! I am not! Not yet, anyway... Whatever, just get out of here! What's the big deal? It ain't like she can see anything. Right? Man, just when things were getting good... Besides, it ain't like you got anything up there that's worth hiding! A-Are you okay? He didn't try anything, did he? Can I ask you something? What does Mugen look like? What do you mean? All I can see is my image of him in my head. Y-You shouldn't waste your time on a guy like him. He's a complete toad! Honestly, he's less than human. He's more like a monkey or a gorilla. What? No, it's nothing. Honestly, I swear... I've never met a woman who has her guard up as high as she does. I like her even more now. What do you want? I'm sorry. What was that all about? And that's why I'm absolutely positive that he's somewhere in Nagasaki. The samurai who smells of sunflowers, I mean. It's been so long since I last saw him that I can barely remember him, though. And when I meet him, I'm gonna beat him senseless. Oh. What about you, Sara? Is it a girl? No, a boy. Oh, a son, huh? I know what you want to say. But there's nothing that I can do about it. No more than I can make my eyes see again. Have you ever thought that you'd be better off if you didn't reach Nagasaki? N-No, why? When you do, it will mean that your journey will be over, right? It's kinda eerie. It's like you're seeing straight into my heart. Because I can't see, my other senses have become sharper. Like scents. Or the sensation of the air on my skin. The auras of living things, that sort of thing. Like that of your friend who is tucked into the breast of your kimono, for instance. That's amazing! But one thing that I can't sense is what people are feeling. Which is the one that you don't want to leave? W-What do you mean? I-It's not like that... We don't have that kind of relationship. I don't know. But I sometimes find myself thinking, But I know that isn't possible. Oh. What about you, Sara? When will your journey end? When I die, I suppose. Because that is my lot in life. It's my fate. I wonder if we can reunite them... Everyone has their own problems to deal with in life. People shouldn't meddle in the affairs of others. But they're a family! Whatever happens, families are always better off being together. C'mon, now! C'mon! C'mon! Are you listening to me? What did you pray for? At the shrine back there. For your son? Actually, there is a favor that I want to ask you about that. I see. You wish to go see your son. What, really? Man, I haven't had a chance to do anything yet... I want you to pick something for me. Something that a boy would like. I don't know much about that stuff... Hey, kid. Tell me what you'd wanna have. Hm... Your sword! I'm gonna chop you to pieces, kid! Hey, tell us what we should get. I want one of them to come with me. Mugen or Jin. Either one. Hey! I wonder if he will like this...? Beats me. As far back as I can remember, I never had any parents. I wouldn't know. You and I might be a lot alike. I never knew the meaning of the word "happiness. " The closest I came was when my son was born, and I had the same dreams as any mother. Is something wrong? It's nothing. I'm sorry. It's just... Sorry. Sara? You understand, don't you? That's the only life that is open to you. Never forget that. Aw, man... Today's the last day we're gonna be able to eat this great food? Eat or speak, choose one. I'm just sayin'... Attention, please! Jin... I want you to go with her. Go with Sara. Say what? More to the point, why not me?! It'd be too dangerous for her to be all alone with you! And she's safe with this bozo?! Jin would never do something like that. Sara wants to live with her son. But it sounds like there will be a lot of difficulties standing in her way... Anyway, I want you to do all you can to help her. Very well. Thank you for everything that you've done for me. I hope we meet again. Well then, be in good health. Take care! That bastard sure didn't put up much of a fight. I can't believe it... After we traveled together all this way, how could he agree so easily...? I thought that Jin was gonna say no! But he didn't...! I'd rather have gone with her, too! Of all the stupid... He didn't...! Oh, shut up! Quit your crying! Jin, you jerk! Who hired you? Someone that you and your friends are no match for. To tell you the truth, I don't want to do this. But this was meant to be. I see... It seems that there is no need to hold back against you. You're definitely skilled enough to have killed Enshiro Mariya. What?! What's going on...? Can she see my movements? It's not my eyes that can see them.
