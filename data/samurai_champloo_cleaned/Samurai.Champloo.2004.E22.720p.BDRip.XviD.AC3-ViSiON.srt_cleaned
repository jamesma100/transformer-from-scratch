Long ago, the stars glittering in the night sky acted as a vital set of guideposts to travelers. These heavenly bodies were thought to be everlasting, that they would shine forever. It is for this reason that when meteors or comets suddenly fell from the skies, they were feared as sinister omens. It was believed that something terrible would befall anyone who saw these shining objects. And no wonder. Even after a scholar named Shunkai Shibukawa was appointed as the Shogunate 's first official astronomer at the start of the Edo era, most people were still unaware that the Earth was round. A shooting star! I wish that we find the samurai who smells of sunflowers soon. I wish that we make it to Nagasaki safely. And I wanna eat until I'm stuffed! Isn't that a-- Hey, isn't that a matsutake mushroom? What, you don't know what those are? They call them the jewels of the mountains. They're worth a lot of money. Hey! C'mon, spit it out! Mushrooms are spread by spores. In other words, if you see one, there are... Over here, too. Darn it! Geez, I'm stuffed... They're all gone... They ate every last one... Oh, that reminds me. The horoscope section in the newspaper said to beware of mushrooms. us that before we ate 'em! Ow... Is everyone all right? Where are we? Jin? Mugen? Your hands are freezing. What's wrong with you? They're as cold as a corpse's. This is amazing... What is this place? They seem to be excavating something. Hey! D-Don't scare us like that! We thought you were ghosts or something. Sorry about that. Try to be more careful! piled onto men, one atop the other. ? enough to fill the valley to the brim. ? the stones like a river! ? The Descent into Kurikara. " The end! Well, well, what have we here? To think that wayward travelers would find their way to this place. Um... What is it that you're doing here? My good visitor, were you aware that these two holes symbolize the sun and the moon? And were you aware that the music that issues forth from the biwa is the sound of the stars themselves? Strum the strings of this biwa! Do so, and one can even call down the stars from the night sky! Who the hell are you? Yes, yes, how rude of me. Even so, one must remember that we were here first. It seems unreasonable for visitors who have wandered in to demand to know who we are, does it not? Very well. Being sensitive to the order in which one is introduced is old-fashioned. Also, I would find it mortifying to be mocked as some official at a sports meet. What's your point? You may address me as Shige. The blood of the Heike flows in me. I have taken it upon myself to excavate the buried treasure of the Heike. Buried treasure? In a place like this? I can only say that it must exist. It is for that reason that I cannot say for certain that it does not. Have you ever heard that expression before? I must admit, it would be unfair to demand that you simply take my word for it. So I offer you this. Take a look. This genealogy is proof that I am a descendant of the Heike. That is why I have every right to claim this buried treasure for myself. It is common knowledge that the treasure of the Heike is buried here in the land of Kyushu. And its location is indicated right here. A map drawn in invisible ink... I don't buy it. Oh, I see that you remain skeptical. Surely you don't mean to say that communication can be built on a foundation of doubt, do you? Also, it is trivial statements which give rise to the gap between your generation and mine, young lady. I have a bad feeling about this. Let's go. Yes, yes. It is the way of the world today to see other people from only one perspective, rejecting all other possibilities in the form of making up your mind. It cannot be helped. However, does one not need money to keep oneself fed? It has been five years since we began our search. And now, travelers appear just as we are about to reach the buried treasure. Surely, the hand of fate is at work here. Perhaps you would care to assist us, as we are shorthanded at the moment. What'll you pay us? Ten percent of the treasure once we find it. That is gold enough to fund the restoration of an entire country. Even ten percent would be a large sum. Wait a minute! We don't have time for this! We need to get to Nagasaki. If you are going to Nagasaki, then you need it all the more. Battles cannot be fought on an empty stomach. Do they not say, "Those who do not work deserve to eat, sleep, and play"? I guess you got a deal, then. I will have these two show you the way. I leave them to you, Sabini. Fuupa. Yes, master. Geez, why does this always happen to us? We're only doing this for a little while, got it? You needn't be in such a hurry. Make yourselves at home. After all, there is no escape from this place. There's something fishy about that Shige guy. At the very least, we will save several days' worth of lodging and food expenses. If we find the treasure, let's snatch it and hightail it outta here. That map was kinda suspicious, too. Anyway, how about something to eat? Um, about that... You've got some food, right? If you don't mind eating these... Hey, wait a minute! In recent years, it has been said that life here on Earth sprang from organisms that were brought here by meteors. No one can deny that unknown viruses or organisms might lurk in these meteors that have traveled here from the far reaches of space. This is Penta, a self-professed psychic. It was he who divined the location of the buried treasure. Explosives were then planted in the bedrock that blocked the way to the treasure. I can only say that it must exist! Damn it, that bastard's working us like dogs... You've got nobody to blame but yourselves. Hang on for just a while longer. The dowsing rods apparently picked something up just beyond that bedrock. Huh? I could have sworn his right arm was cut off... Maybe I imagined it. Hey, how many days have we been here? It feels as if it's been several days, or it could be several months. You lose track of time when you're working here. Once we get that treasure, the five years that we've spent here will come to an end, along with the rule of those impudent Genji. Genji? I swear... " Onwards to Kamakura, " my ass. That Yoritomo bastard is so full of himself. Kamakura? Um... We're in the Tokugawa Era now. Okay, let's take a quick break. Yeah. Come on, don't the people here seem a little strange to you? I mean, how can they live off of nothing but wasabi? As I recall, wasabi has antibacterial and preservative properties, but even so... Hey, I could swear that those two guys were... They're rotting?! I can't believe it... They're eating wasabi to keep their bodies from rotting? What do you think? Is this not the perfect place to forget the troubles of the floating world? Who are you people? My goodness. That's quite a philosophical question that you are asking. Who am I, indeed? I was hoping to learn the answer to that myself. Master. As expected, we simply don't have enough manpower. I have no choice, then. I will go summon reinforcements. Excuse me. I'm beat, I'm beat... I have heartburn again... Now that he mentions it, maybe those weren't matsutake mushrooms that they ate back then. This is fishy... Are you two also...? What's her problem? Come to think of it, something has been bothering me. Didn't that Heike family tree seem suspicious to you? Beats me. If that's what's bothering you, it's in here. Shall we take a look? Damn thing looks like a game of ladders. Geez, I'm hungry... I guess I'll try some of this. No! Nooo! Nooo! H-Help me! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Well, then. Now that you have discovered our little secret, it seems that I have no choice but to kill you, as well. That's how it's gonna be, huh? You shoulda said so in the first place. I woulda been happy to fight you guys whenever you wanted! Hey, what's the matter? You done already? What the--? What the hell? How come you guys ain't dead? What's goin' on here?! Hey! They're already dead, you see. It's impossible for you to kill them. Oh, it's all right. I'll bring you back to life soon enough. There ain't nothing right about this! Goodness, that was a close call. My head was hanging by a flap of skin. What's this? I don't believe it... Come, join us and let's give those Genji scum a nasty surprise together. What're you talking about? Don't you get it?! This is the Edo Era! The Heike and the Genji are both gone! What did you say? You think you've been digging here for five years, but you've really been at it for 500! Don't you guys even realize that you died a long time ago? You stupid little girl... Just listen to the nonsense you're spouting! Just a minute! Take a close look at this. This family line here. Hey, it's not connected... But that means-- You're totally unrelated! Yes. You are not a descendant of the Heike. You lie! It's not connected... It can't be... I've been digging for so long... After all I've gone through... All of my hard work... It was all for nothing? All of it?! It can't be! At this point, the matter of whether or not I'm related by blood is a moot question, don't you think? After all, we don't have a drop of blood left in our bodies, anyway. Why don't we forgive and forget, let bygones be bygones, and carry on as before? Not gonna happen, huh? No? Thank you for watching! A mushroom! Dawn comes, and we part ways once again My dreams becoming distant apparitions I turn to the warm wind for help, the wind I felt every time you held me As I was bathed in the light that followed on your heels Spring is announced when the wild plants break out in a dance Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields are patterns of grass set out to dry The autumn moon rises, let's celebrate its fullness Winter passes by, and I count off the days and months again I can still see the too-distant blue sky when I close my eyes (It was so warm) As I reminisce, I take your hand as I pluck flowers and sing Within the memories that are now coming back to me I'm setting out to find my way back to you Spring is announced when the mountain leaves break out in dance Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with plains grass patterns are set out to dry The autumn moon rises, let's celebrate its fullness Winter passes by, and I count off the days and months again Dawn comes, and we part ways once again My dreams becoming...
