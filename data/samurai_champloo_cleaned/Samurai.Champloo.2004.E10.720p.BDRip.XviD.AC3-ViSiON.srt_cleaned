Thank you, come again! And who might you be? You know that I'm Munetada Tajima of the Fu'un Sekisai school, don't you? Of course. That's why I chose you. All right, then. I'll take you on for a little after-dinner exercise. Come on! Geez, I'm so hungry... I'm sick and tired of hearing you say that. Come on, we haven't had anything to eat since the checkpoint... Then go drink from the river or something. Sorry, friend, but we don't even have money for lodgings. We don't have anything to give you as alms. I'm glad to hear you say that. You came at a perfect time. We've been in a bind because we're so short on help. Once you're finished wiping down the floors, please polish the Buddha. All right? You bald bastard, who do you think we are, your slaves?! Hey, quit your complaining! He's feeding us and letting us stay here for free! That reminds me. Don't forget to chop firewood and mend the sliding doors. Screw you! Oh, geez... Damn it, I'm always the one who has to clean up their messes! Talk about scary... It's another street killing. This is the third one this month. And the only people that the killer goes after are skilled samurai. And it says here that they've gotten fed up and put a ten ryo bounty on his head. No way! Ten ryo?! Hey, are you listening to me? A ten ryo bounty! Ten ryo! That much money would get us to Nagasaki with no problem. A street killer, huh? I can't really say that I'm interested. Is this guy a real badass? He has to be. I mean, he's specifically targeting and killing skilled samurai. Okay, then. Well, I'm going out for a bit. Hey, wait! Jin, see to the rest of the chores here, okay? Hey! Good grief... If you see the street killer, it means that he sees you, too. Once that happens, you're as good as dead. Oh, right... I wonder if there are some clues or something. Hey. Who's the best swordsman around here? What the heck are you asking him that for? The killer's gonna go after him next, right? Oh... Well? Hello? Seishiro Momoi. Thanks, mister. Indeed. This is Master Seishiro Momoi, instructor at the Gensou Academy, also known as the Human Dynamo. You want to be my disciple? Glad to hear it. Now the street killer will-- Are you the street killer?! You've got guts, showing your face in broad daylight! I said you were making a mistake, didn't I?! P-Please, wait! It was all a lie! The whole Human Dynamo thing was a lie that I spread myself! S-Spare me! This guy is useless. Yes, I saw one of the corpses. There wasn't a single sword cut on it, but blood was spurting out of his eyes, ears, and every other orifice when he died. How was he killed, then? I have no idea. If the authorities could figure that out, he would've been arrested long ago. What's the big idea?! Hey, there's no need to shout. I'm sure this nice gentleman didn't bump into me on purpose. I'm sure my friends would be willing to overlook this unfortunate incident, if you give us a little something as an apology. C'mon, say something! You wanna end up as food for the ravens, buddy? I have no interest in the likes of you. What I'm saying is, I'm not interested in weaklings. you are, you bastard?! Shit! Monster! That guy's a monster! That's enough for today, I think. I'll finish this last log, then. I'll go get dinner ready. What a lively piece of firewood! Perhaps I'll use this as kindling for today's bath. What'll it be? Sake. That won't buy you much, but maybe that's for the best. What's that mean? Haven't you heard? These parts have been dangerous lately. That street killer, you mean? Yeah, business here has been lousy because of him. Hit me again. Sorry, mister, but that's all that 1 0 mon will buy you. Excuse me. Help yourself to mine. When they speak of the joy of sake, that is only when you are slightly tipsy. I've had a little too much to drink tonight. Oops. My apologies. It looks like I really have had too much to drink tonight. How about you? You know anything, buddy? I have no idea. I'm rather out of touch with public affairs. Word has it that he only goes after tough people. Why do you think that is? I don't know. I couldn't really say. But I once heard a story that goes something like this... Long ago on the mainland, there was a mountain-climbing expert. This man had climbed an amazingly tall mountain. But no one had ever seen this mountain, so they couldn't comprehend the magnitude of this accomplishment. Reluctantly, the man continued to climb mountains that were said to be even taller. Day after day he climbed, all in order to make the people recognize his greatness. In the end, the man made the mountains his home and he became a demon. And? The story ends there. I don't get the point. Forgive me, I suppose there was no point to the story. Well, this is where we go our separate ways. Watch out for that street killer. Thank you. You, too. You're him, ain't ya? What the hell kinda fighting stance is that? Impressive, you dodged it... This should be entertaining. There he is! It's the killer! The night of the next full moon. Let us meet here again. What the hell...? What a beautiful moon. I love watching it from here. Oh, there you are! I'm sorry! That's all right, miss. Um, about that street killer... They say that the corpses were bleeding from everywhere, even though there wasn't a cut on them. Listen, don't you think this is too dangerous? Jin! What the heck do you think you're doing?! My apologies. But the speed of your movements makes me think that you're no ordinary priest. What do you mean, not an ordinary priest? Hey. Mugen! When did you get back? Hey, your hand... I wouldn't call those nothing! You ran into the street killer, didn't you? The guy had this weird-ass sword. It was like a powerful wind shot out of it or something. And when it hit me, it... I knew it. The street killer is most likely a man called Shoryu. What, you know the guy? He was once a pupil of mine. At one time, I was a warrior who had his own dojo. Shoryu-- No, at the time, his name was Ukon-- was a student at my dojo back then. He was a man of considerable skill, and he devoted himself heart and soul to the martial arts, spending each day in their study. Eventually, Ukon was sent on a sea voyage on the orders of this domain's lord, but the ship met with disaster. It was believed that the ship had gone down with all hands. But Ukon miraculously washed ashore on the continent, and escaped death. In that land, he apparently encountered a strange martial art. Who could have known how great an impact that would have on him...? Ten years after he had disappeared, he returned to these lands after crossing the sea, determined to make it or die trying. But he had changed so completely that he almost seemed a different person. Learning the martial arts of the continent has made me realize how weak and empty those that I had previously studied were. There is a technique called Hakkei. It allows you to defeat an opponent, not with strength, but with the power of your inner chi. After arduous training, I mastered this technique. But what of the warriors of this country? What have they done? I wish to teach the ways of the true martial arts to the samurai who have grown indolent and weak in this peaceful country. I want to do something about this corrupt country. I am now called Shoryu. I yield! What's going on in here? H-He's dead! What have you done? What kind of man kills during training...? You attack a helpless man, and then go on to kill him... What do you think the martial arts are for?! Once mastered, the martial arts are a tool for killing. In other words, they are to utterly and completely take the life of your opponent. I hereby expel you from this dojo. I-I'm what? Expelled? You're throwing me out? But why? I'm expelling you because you don't understand why. Impossible... You're throwing me out?! You can't be serious! You're scared of being beaten by me, is that it? Is that why you're throwing me out? You coward! After Shoryu left my dojo, he wandered from domain to domain, trying to be accepted into service. But I've heard that he was treated as a heretic no matter where he went, and no domain would take him in. After that, they say he began to hate this world that wouldn't give him recognition or even accept him, and he began to go from dojo to dojo, killing the master of each one. As for me, in repentance for being unable to save the soul of my pupil, which had become tainted with darkness, I became the priest that you see before you. I mustn't allow Shoryu to commit any more sins. But he is now virtually invincible. I doubt that there is anyone who is capable of stopping him. I'm happy to hear that. I'm glad I'm gonna have the chance to take on a guy like that. What's gotten into you? Why the sudden change in heart? Ow! I've never seen Mugen like this before. It means that this is one opponent that he isn't sure he can defeat. Yep, you gotta meditate under a waterfall... Screw that. It isn't a sword that Shoryu kills with, it is his chi. In this country, the technique is sometimes called the Armor Piercer. Once mastered, it can destroy the body's internal organs without so much as scratching the opponent's armor. Maybe that's true, but it can't hurt ya if it don't hit ya, right? The moon's so big... Well, I'm heading out for a bit. Hey, you haven't forgotten, have you? You're gonna help me look for the samurai who smells of sunflowers, right? Yeah, I know. Don't forget. I will be the one who kills you. Who do you think you are, my wife or something? I knew you would come. You don't know how happy this makes me. Ever since I returned from the continent, everyone has feared me. It never even occurred to them to recognize my strength. In spite of the fact that my skills were far superior to those that the people call masters. And so, I taught them a lesson. I showed them who was really the strongest. Spare me the introductions. Let's get this started. As you wish. Son of a... You exceeded my expectations. Why do you fight me? Is it because I have a bounty on my head? I don't give a damn about the bounty anymore! I'm having the time of my life right now! As am I... But I think it's about time that I put an end to this. I-Impossible... This can't be! This time you're mine...! Ukon...
