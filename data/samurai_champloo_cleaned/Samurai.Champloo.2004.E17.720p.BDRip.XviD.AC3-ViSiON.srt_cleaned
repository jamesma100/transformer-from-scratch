Bastard... Do you work for Matsumae domain? Where the hell is that? And who the hell are you?! Say that you killed me if you like. I might as well be dead already. I'm looking for a samurai who smells of sunflowers. Um... Would it be okay if I went with you, Okuru? We're police officers with the Matsumae domain magistrate's office. Come along peacefully, Okuru! Give yourself up! I guess you guys ain't your usual street punks... Look, fellas, you're makin' a big mistake here. What makes you think I'm the guy you're lookin' for? We're after a man by the name of Okuru. He's a criminal who has fled all the way from Matsumae. We were told that he's wearing strange clothes and is hiding in these mountains. So, what did this Okuru guy do, anyway? This man isn't Okuru. Pull out! Pull out! Hey! Come back here, damn it! You mistake me for somebody else, and you're gonna take off without even apologizing? You cannot come with me. Why not? I've killed domain soldiers and am on the run. If you went with me, you would become a fugitive as well. The guys that I've been with up until now have done a lot worse than that. If you have friends, you should go with them. Those coldhearted jerks are no friends of mine... Once you have traveled with someone, they become like family. Like brothers. You are not all alone in this world. Okuru, are you always going to travel alone? My wife and daughter are always with me. Now, go to sleep. He was probably driven mad by the disease. I heard that he killed everyone in his village, and then even killed the domain soldiers who went in to capture him. The man even killed his wife and daughter. If we leave him running loose, there's no telling what he might do! Driven insane, huh? Funny, he didn't look crazy to me. I'll take him down. What? You better warn your buddies. Tell 'em to stay outta my way! I have no more seeds for you. What about that man at the river? As we thought, he doesn't appear to be Okuru. He is too young, and he said that he was from the Ryukyu Islands. Anyone who interferes is to be considered an accomplice. feel free to kill him. I swear, these mountains are crawling with crazy people. Lord Tamoto! We found the remains of a fire downstream on the riverbank. As well as shavings left from arrows being carved. Okuru is an archer. No doubt about it. He's here in this forest. Reinforcements will be arriving from Matsumae soon, too. We can't pass up this opportunity. We're going to take Okuru's head! You want those guys to find you or something? That music sounds a lot like something I heard when I was a kid. Where are you from? The Ryukyus. Islands way to the south. I'm from the far north. Funny thing, isn't it? We're from places that are nowhere near each other, but I've heard similar music. So, you must be Okuru. They were right on your tail. Those guys from Matsumae domain or whatever. You made a whole heap of trouble for me. They thought I was you. And did they buy you off? All I want is to go one-on-one with you. They said you lost your mind because of some disease. But you don't look that way to me. They say you're a guy who even killed his own wife and kid. Momo? Okuru? What happened? Just now, I saw something up there. I don't know what it was... It was carrying a sword! Or more to the point, what the heck are you doing here? Why are you here? That's none of your business. Something tells me you didn't finally feel sorry and come back to me. I thought that you might have drowned. This was floating in the river. And you were gonna keep it as a memento of me or something? I thought I might place it on your corpse as an offering. Well, thanks anyway. What happened to your arm? Don't tell me that jerk actually cut you! It's just a scratch. I got it when I jumped over a waterfall. Jumped over a waterfall...? I'm amazed you survived. I haven't seen him. I see. Oh, I know! Wait here a second. I'll go get some medicinal herbs. I'm pretty sure they were over here... It was people from the domain who brought the disease to my village. While I was away, the village became a mountain of corpses. It was a terrible sight. That is how my village was destroyed. It makes no difference to me whether or not you believe me. I've seen eyes like yours before. They look like something. Like the half-open eyes of a head that's been chopped off. They're still a little bit moist, and you can't tell where they're lookin'. Are you really alive? Jin! What's going on? What're you doing? Did you think you could fool me? Do you know why these mountains are revered by so many people? Because they say you will be reborn here. Death and rebirth... Everyone comes here in search of them. These seem to be one of those mountains. Are you looking to be reborn, too? Yukimaru... You won't truly be dead until I kill you with my own two hands! You are still young. I am an old man of nearly forty. I have lived past my time. Perhaps it is time to put an end to my endless flight. You're pretty spry for an old man! Why do you keep running from me?! You are determined to go through with this? Even if you betray me, even if you turn your back on me, I will never let you get away from me! What's the matter? Outta arrows already? When I said I only wanted to make a name for myself, that was a lie... I only wanted... one thing. To be you. Yukimaru... What the hell do you think you're doing?! Who was he, Jin? Did you know him? He was like a little brother to me. That's ancient history now. We found him! It's Okuru! Meet up with the others! Hurry! Okuru...? Did they say Okuru just now? Yes. Hey, come back! Can you hear me? There's nowhere you can run! Surrendering and coming out is in your own best interest! You bastards, stay out of this! Geez, these guys are getting on my nerves... Do you know this Okuru man? I have to help him! I owe him my life! You have a strong sense of duty, I see. When duty goes out of style, the world will be nothing but darkness! You should go. I am tired of running. Hey! And I must settle matters with those people. Perhaps what you said is true. That day in my village, perhaps I became one of the dead. Oh, geez...! Which way?! Momo? Where's Okuru?! This way? Okuru. We meet at last. Now I can finally bring your head back home with me. You people don't know what really happened. That official didn't make the slightest effort to save anyone. He was just afraid that the disease would spread further, so he simply burned the village to the ground. Even if that's true, I'm still going to bring you in. Those are my orders. Okuru? You bastards! Keep your hands off him! He's mine! What're you-- Y-You... You monster! I never met anybody like him before. I know he's still alive. Something in my gut says he is. That rumor must've been a mix of stories about those two. I swear, what a load of garbage... So tell me. Why are you trying to find this sunflower samurai guy? Is it revenge? That's right. Revenge for my mom. Or something like that. At any rate, wars aren't won on an empty stomach. Damn straight! Hey, where are you going?! Where the hell is this Nagasaki place, anyway? They got any good food there? I'm told they have a sponge cake there called a castella that was brought over from Europe. C'mon, let's get moving!
