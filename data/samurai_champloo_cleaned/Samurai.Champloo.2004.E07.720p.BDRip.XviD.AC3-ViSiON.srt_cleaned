Place your bets, place your bets! This is the last of our savings, got it? Be careful with it! Bet on three! Don't be stupid. Five. You do everything you can to get on my nerves, don't you? That's my line. You bastard... One of these days, I'm gonna make you cry uncle. Cry uncle? Does anyone actually say that? I've never heard that expression. Let's play! No way! We actually won! Awesome! I could have sworn that an animal-- No, it must be my imagination. Welcome! Hanamaki noodles for me. With a double order of shrimp tempura. Got it! Coming right up! Our first food in three days... We'll be doing more than smelling it this time! We're gonna be able to eat it, too...! What a jerk! Thanks for waiting! Three bowls comes to 50 mon! Hey, now, pay up front. Sure, sure, not a problem. C'mon, pay the man. I can't believe it! I've been pickpocketed! It was that guy just now! Say what?! Where'd the bastard go?! Hold it. Excuse me? My apologies. Bastard! Son of a-- W-What's your problem?! Ouch... Wrong guy... Geez! What's the big idea, beating up innocent people? Piece of cake. You dumbass! Look at you, clutching your wallet and looking around nervously! It's the same as shouting, " Look at me, I'm carrying something valuable! " I-I'm sorry, big guy... I swear, I've never seen anybody as stupid as you. Listen, it's times when you're carrying something this valuable that you gotta walk along with a look on your face that says it ain't worth anything. Watch where you're going! So anyway, you do it like-- That little punk! You idiots, what're you standing around for?! Go after him! Y-Yes, sir! C'mon, let's give up already. It was money we won by gambling, anyway. No way in hell. A man can't fight on an empty stomach. There's no sign of him! Big guy! He's not over here, either! You morons! Are you trying to ruin my reputation?! If the boss finds out about this, cutting off all the fingers on both my hands won't be enough to make up for it! I don't believe it... Hey! Where the hell are you, you little punk?! Get your ass out here! Hey, does a young guy live here? You people barge into a stranger's home without asking... Have you ever heard of the word " manners"? Besides, I don't have a son. I'll have to ask you to leave! Our apologies. We'll go give the area another once-over. You stake out the place from over there. What? By myself? Hey, wait! Hey, this is the real deal! Shinsuke, what are you doing with something this dangerous? I need the money. Let me think... My broker fee will be 70. I'll fence it for you for that much. Seventy percent?! You're kidding! You can't go through legal channels with this, you know? Besides, how would a rookie like you be able to fence this? Huh? All right. Come back tomorrow. I'll have the deal set up by then. Shinsuke? What, you're still up? Have you been out working until this hour? Something like that. If this latest job works out, it'll make me a lot of money. Then I'll be able to buy you better medicine. A while ago, some strange men came here to see you. Who were those people? Beats me. Then what did they want with you?! What're you doing? Don't overexert yourself. Go to sleep. Shinsuke, you aren't-- Aren't what? You aren't doing things that would make you too ashamed to look people in the eye, are you? What're you saying? I'd never do anything like that. Don't worry about me, just worry about your health. Hey. See him? No, no one came. I guess that's that. There was a stable up the road, remember? We'll spend the night there. Sure... Who are you? Um, I'm sorry. Are you... Shinsuke's girlfriend? I suppose he's that age now. That's so good! I've never seen anyone look so happy over eating dried sweet potatoes. I'm sorry... these, eat all you like. Still, I'm amazed that he found himself such an adorable girlfriend. About that... He doesn't have a father, and I have this frail body... That's given him a difficult life, even though he's really still at that age where a boy wants his parents to take care of him. Well, well... So, he's doing the things that young men do. Has he talked to you about anything lately? A-About what? No, never mind. I'm sorry. It's just that he's seemed a little strange lately. I've been giving her this medicine every day, following your instructions to the letter, Doctor, but she isn't getting any better. I never said that this would cure her. With this medicine, the best you can hope for is that she might regain some of her strength. There's nothing I can do. That's all you can buy with the money you have. There are better medicines available, of course. For instance, there's Korean ginseng, which is said to be a cure-all. It costs a hundred times as much as this medicine here, though. Can you afford something like that? I'm sorry, but I am running a business here. Hey, are you the guy they call Hikoichi? What do you want? I'm looking for something. Where'd you hear about me? It's something that's way too much for a small-time fence like you to handle. Oh? Don't play dumb with me! I know that pickpocket punk came to see you yesterday! I... I don't know who you're talking about! What do you think you're doing?! Oh, you'll feel like talking soon enough. I told you I don't know who he is, didn't I?! Stop it! Put it out! See? You feel like talking now, don't you? Hey, you! Do you remember who I am? You can't get away from me. You're a hard man to find. You've been a bad boy. You oughta return what doesn't belong to you, got it? Who the heck are you guys? Careful, miss. I think you know what I'll do if you shout-- Big guy! Bastard! You little-- What's going on here?! Hey! What are you doing?! Damn it... Back off! Stay away! If you come any closer, I'll slit her throat! Hey, what do you think you're doing? Give yourself up peacefully! Kiss my ass! Don't come any closer! Got it?! Do you hear me?! If you come near me, I'm really gonna kill this girl! But... It's no big deal! What do you want us to do, big guy? Should we storm the place? Don't be stupid! What the hell are you thinking? We have to get the stuff back without the cops spotting us! Are you in pain? It's nothing. That look on your face says otherwise. Don't you get it? If I have to, I'm gonna kill you. I met your mother. If she knew you were picking pockets, I bet it would break her heart. Did... Did you tell her that I'm a pickpocket?! Of course I couldn't tell her that. I don't want to make a good mother like her worry. Don't talk like you know what I'm going through. I do. You should be grateful that your mother's alive. Where are your parents? My father hasn't been around for a long time. And my mother died a year ago. I disobeyed my mother all the time. I made her worry about me all the time. All those things that I really wanted to tell her... That I wanted to ask her... Now I'll never be able to. I need money. There weren't any legitimate places that would hire a kid like me. The only people who say that money doesn't matter in this world are the ones with lots of it. Without money, you can't even buy good medicine. And that's the ugly truth of the matter. Attention, criminal! This is your final warning! If you haven't surrendered within a minute of sundown, we will storm the place! Got that? See, there she is! That little-- This explains why we haven't seen her all day. Hey! Stay away! You hear me?! We found you, you pickpocketing bastard! Hey, hold it! Where are you going?! I got unfinished business with that guy! You ought to surrender. There's nowhere for you to run now. Forget it. I can't get arrested by those guys, not now. Then I'll be a decoy! You run away while I have everybody's attention. Why would you-- We can't have that. You're not getting away this time. We don't have time to fool around. Hand over the stuff right now! Outta my way! Who is that guy? An idiot. Found ya! Who are you guys? Move it! Wait! Let the boy go! Wha--? You can have it back! Ow! You guys are startin' to piss me off! This way! My opium...! Hey. If I ever see you again, I'll repay you for what you did today. So... Same to you! Remember me! He got away! After him! Stop in the name of the law! You can't get away! Back off! Stay away from me! Stay away! Oh, it's you. Is something wrong? No, I... Shinsuke hasn't come home. Did something happen to him? It's no big deal. I just came by to say hello. Well, see you. I'll come back later. He isn't coming back, is he? He isn't coming back. It's all right. Deep down, I've always expected it. I had a feeling that something like this would happen someday. He was doing something bad, wasn't he? And he paid the price for it, right? That's why he-- You're wrong. He's-- Shinsuke was-- Dawn comes, and we part ways once again My dreams becoming distant apparitions I turn to the warm wind for help, the wind I felt every time you held me As I was bathed in the light that followed on your heels Spring is announced when the wild plants break out in a dance Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields are patterns of grass set out to dry The autumn moon rises, let's celebrate its fullness Winter passes by, and I count off the days and months again I can still see the too-distant blue sky when I close my eyes (It was so warm) As I reminisce, I take your hand as I pluck flowers and sing Within the memories that are now coming back to me I'm setting out to find my way back to you Spring is announced when the mountain leaves break out in dance Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with plains grass patterns are set out to dry The autumn moon rises, let's celebrate its fullness Winter passes by, and I count off the days and months again Dawn comes, and we part ways once again My dreams becoming distant apparitions I turn to the warm wind for help, the wind I felt every time you held me As I was bathed in the light that followed on your heels
