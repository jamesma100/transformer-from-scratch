Okay, you people! Dig the wax outta your ears and listen up!. C'mon! Listen up! If you learn one thing today, learn this. I do what other people can't do. Those people who can't, they say I'm not with it. Well, they're right. I'm not with it. All you unwashed masses will probably figure it out after I'm gone. You'll realize that the man named Nagamitsu was a real-deal bigshot. That's the kind of man that you're gonna go down fighting against. So let's make sure that you at least die with some style! Say your prayers... Huh? W-Wait! My name isn't Jin! I'm-- I'm starving... I wanna take a bath... Sleeping outdoors is a crime in Edo... In any case, we have to raise at least enough money to pay for lodgings... That's it, I'm done. I can't walk any further... Welcome. What do you think? It's really cute, huh? It's lacquerware, too. I can't give you anything for it. It's scratched here and here, and the lacquer's wearing off, too. Do you have anything else? Sorry, but I don't take anything unless it's brand-name. Besides, a sword like that wouldn't fetch a high price. Told ya so. Anything else? He's gonna hold onto 'em, that's all. You can get 'em right back. Forget it. Don't be such a tightwad. C'mon! Stop that. My word! Ew, gross... What're you doing? These are very uncommon! Rare items that you see once in a lifetime! So... How do we go about earning money? Are you listening? Big guy? Hey! Look at that babe. My heart's pounding. Got it, Shinpachi? I'm on it, big guy. Pardon me, would you like a pear? I think my boss wants to talk to you. Who? Why doesn't he come over here himself? Well, the big guy is kinda shy. No thanks. Listen... Forget it, no way. Ask all you want, the answer will still be no. This woman is going to take some work. But the thing is, that only makes her all the more worthwhile. Who, me? I'm a man who's gonna be big. Believe it or not, big. No, more than that. Bigger than the biggest. My name is... Nagamitsu Sakon Shogen! This is his idea of shy? I found him! It's the real deal this time! You need me? I'm staying at this address, so come by, all right? I'll be waiting for you! Later! Oh, good grief! I swear, it's tough to be a girl with sex appeal. Being hit on... Well, that's one hassle that you guys would never understand. Refill over here. From the customer over there. Hey, that lady's pretty hot... This won't do at all. Water has more flavor than this. Just who do you think I am? Um, who are you? People call me Budou Kiba. Grape fang...? Thanks for the drinks. This won't do. Two fine men shouldn't be drinking all by themselves. You need a feminine flower to have a good time getting drunk, don't you think? Excuse me... When that which is given and that which is received are in balance, that is when men and women are bound together. Would you care to join me for a drink? Somewhere with a little more atmosphere? Well, I guess I don't have a problem with that. What're you talking about?! C'mon, Jin! Say something, too! I know a place with delicious foreign drinks. And we won't be bothered there, either. Hey, lady! Young women are praised for their looks, and nothing more. It is only women who are mature in years who gain respect for being beautiful. I swear, it's tough to be a man with sex appeal, ain't it? You morons! Fine, see if I care! Jerks... I'm gonna go see this guy, you hear?! So, you're him. The one they call the Glasses-Hunting Samurai who's been causing trouble around here lately. An ambush, huh? But the thing is, those aren't the real deal. Those glasses of yours are fake! And that means... that you aren't Jin. I'll be the first to admit that I'm a man who will use whatever's around me as a stepping stone to become big. Nevertheless... my policy is to avoid unnecessary fighting. Don't talk so big! I'm here to punish you! Anyway, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do! Die!. Big guy! Way to go, big guy! Midair Finishing Move! Um... Flying Dragon Sword. I had it all planned! Still, it was a needless fight... So you came after all! Shall we go forth to Roppongi Hill? What the hell is this? It's all red! It's called grape wine. It's a drink that comes from beyond the sea. Delicious. A beautiful drink for beautiful lips. If you wish to have beautiful eyes, you should gaze upon beautiful things. No matter how deeply wounded you may be, there is joy in love that is even greater. And the instant she manages to become her true self, that's when a woman experiences the ultimate in elegance. I've been longing for the warm touch of skin lately... However, my policy is to only drink with boys who can hold their liquor better than I can. I think I'll have another. Top me off, too. Oh, I see that you're a strong drinker. Your friend here is awfully quiet. He's always like that. I don't feel like going home tonight... Do you know why I brought you here? This area is gonna be my front lawn one day. And that over there? That's gonna be my house one day. Edo Castle. With that in mind, will you be the Harem of my Heart? Um... I don't think I follow you. If you want to know all about me... That's my autobiography. A work in progress. Well, I call it "The Path to Being Big. " Yes, my past, present, and even my future plans are all written in there. At any rate, I won't be satisfied with being second or third in anything that I do. I want to become bigger than anyone else and make the name Nagamitsu known throughout the land! So tell me. Who's the biggest man in the country? Gawatoku. The Shogun Tokugawa, and that's a fact! And so, I jumped aboard the last ship from the province of Aki. I made my way to Edo alone. Along the way, I defeated some roughneck on his horse on a sandy beach, as well as that Kogarashi bozo, and my reputation started to climb. Yes, until the day when people throughout the land are abuzz with rumors about me, my final objective is... Come out and face me, Tokugawa! I'm too late, huh? Anyway, there I was, wailing away at what I thought was Edo Castle, when suddenly... Uh, mister? That's Osaka Castle. That's what happened. Still, because of that, I met my first follower, Ogura. At around that time, I heard whispered rumors of a legendary man who was undefeated in a thousand duels. And that man's name was... Enshiro Mariya! It would've been perfect. If I could defeat Enshiro and take over his legend of 1,000 victories, I have you now, Mariya! I'm too late, huh? My perfectly laid plans ran headlong into a wall that day. I learned from the remaining disciples that Enshiro had already been killed. The man who struck down the legendary, undefeated Enshiro was none other than his top pupil. A teacher-killer being allowed to assume his undefeated legend? Isn't that preposterous? After that, I added a new entry in my autobiography. Right! This one right here! man with the undefeated legend!! " my own legend will echo through the country! Yo, Nagamitsu! And if I can only make it big, everything will be within my reach! When I talk like this, people might think to themselves, " Nagamitsu is a lonely man. " I'll admit that I might be lonely. But I'm alone of my own free will. And if I'm gonna be lonely anyway... I've had it up to here with being lonely inside a tenement! Big guy! And that's why you're attacking every samurai you come across. Not every samurai! I know that this samurai wears glasses, which is rare even here in Edo. Yes! And that man's name is-- J-J-Jin! Right! Jin! Um... Gosh, I hope you find that-- J-Jin! Right, right. That guy. J-J-Jin. Well, it's late, so I'm gonna head back. Okay! I'll be waiting for you here again tomorrow night, then! Is it a good idea to let her go? Don't be dumb. I'm taking my time on this one. What a fine woman. That indomitable spirit in her eyes reminds me of you-know-who when she was young. Where could those two have run off to at a time like this? Well, bigger doesn't necessarily mean better. No, that's impossible... Jin would never do something like that. You guys! Aw, quiet down... My head... You reek of booze! That woman... The bitch rolled us. Would you two... get your act together?! Get out there and earn it back! Okay! Step right up! Take a look! The two master swordsmen you see before you will amaze you with their astounding sword techniques! If they succeed, feel free to leave money in here. Okay, I've got us a crowd. So, what're you gonna do? I-I'll be fine, I'll be fine... Hey, I need to ask you something... Yeah, what? Well, it's about Jin... Has he ever told you anything about his past? I don't know anything. Why don't you ask him yourself? Well, it's not an easy topic to bring up... Could he really be a bad person? You have her rigged up as a low-rider, I see... Customized palanquins are always lower in value. Say what? Don't try to take advantage of me. Old man, you haven't pawned them yet, have you? Oh, you must have raised some money, huh, sir? I'll only be a minute. At this very moment, a door has opened. And the name of that door is destiny. You couldn't bear to wait until nightfall to meet me, so you followed me, didn't you? Oh, don't feel bad. I understand how you feel. What's this guy's name? Jin of the Mujushin Kenjutsu school?! I'm Bunta Ogura, student of the Mujushin Kenjutsu dojo! Answer me! You're right. I am Jin. You traitor! Prepare to pay for killing our master! Let's step outside. Ogura? No one interfere. I've looked everywhere for you. In order to find you, I even became the follower of a lowlife like that man, and bided my time. Why did you betray him?! Why did a man as great as you betray our master?! I wasn't the one who betrayed him. Even so... I won't make excuses. In any case, the fact of the matter is that I was the one who killed him. Bastard! Holy crap... Ogura was that tough? Kill me! But don't forget that lots of students are out there, and they're after your head. I've made my peace with that. Tell that to the others like you. That's why I'm letting you live today. Some day... we'll avenge him. So, it was all true... Big guy! Luigi! Luigi! It's been so long, Luigi! What's Luigi doing here? Honey, stop goofing off here. Hurry up and come home. I'm so sorry about all that. My husband is a fool. Hey, wait a minute! Listen, men are all idiots, so make sure you get them whipped right away. Farewell, Harem of my Heart. Don't worry, I'll make sure to write about you in my autobiography. What do you think you're doing? Your children are waiting for you with empty stomachs, so hurry it up! Y-Yes, dear... Our money. I'll forget about Enshiro. An even better one would be... Musashi, I guess. He's already dead. Honestly... Men are such idiots. Dawn comes, and we part ways once again My dreams becoming distant apparitions I turn to the warm wind for help, the wind I felt every time you held me As I was bathed in the light that followed on your heels Spring is announced when the wild plants break out in a dance Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields are patterns of grass set out to dry The autumn moon rises, let's celebrate its fullness Winter passes by, and I count off the days and months again I can still see the too-distant blue sky when I close my eyes (It was so warm) As I reminisce, I take your hand as I pluck flowers and sing Within the memories that are now coming back to me I'm setting out to find my way back to you Spring is announced when the mountain leaves break out in dance Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with plains grass patterns are set out to dry The autumn moon rises, let's celebrate its fullness Winter passes by, and I count off the days and months again Dawn comes, and we part ways once again My dreams becoming distant apparitions I turn to the warm wind for help, the wind I felt every time you held me As I was bathed in the light that followed on your heels
