Save Mugen! Please, save Mugen! What do you mean by that? So, it's a trap. Mukuro, you son of a bitch! You played me, didn't you?! Oh, crap! Damn you, you bastard! Mukuro! The pirate ship! What? Which one is it? Mugen's on it! Mugen! Mugen... I can't believe it, he's dead...! That would never happen. Mugen would never die that easily! Calm yourself. In search of new lands I build a new house I thatch the house with reed stalks Gathered neatly in bundles With reeds gathered neatly in bundles I thatch the house with reed stalks Gathered neatly in bundles At the stone wall Let us celebrate the golden house That was built by a hundred black kites Let us celebrate the golden house That was built by a hundred black kites Let us celebrate the golden house That was built by a hundred black kites It's not right... It's not right that they' re so beautiful. Not when we're this sad down here. They can't see anything up there. Looking down from up there, we wouldn't look any bigger than grains of sand. I never... I never knew who my father was. And my mother, she died a long time ago. Mukuro killed her. I want to escape from this place. I want out of this hell. The eighth month is fast approaching And yet I've nothing to wear I want to dress gaily So brother, will you lend me just one sleeve? Whoa, wait just a damn a minute...! I wish to dress my children and loved ones In the one kimono that I own As for me, I will wear vines That I plucked deep in the mountains If you're gonna try to start some shit with me, I'll pay you back with interest! How about it? Why not team up with me? Say what? You and me, we're two of a kind. Both of us are loved by this hell we live in. I don't work with anybody. The light of the full moon shines down Illuminating the world with its divine light When my lover sneaks in to visit me I wish that the clouds would hide that light just a little What're you afraid of? I ain't afraid of nothin'. Then why won't you team up with me? Because I hate your freakin' guts, that's why. Listen, the three of us were born and raised in this hellhole. We're at the bottom, so we can't fall any lower than this. We don't have anything else to lose. Isn't that right? Come with me. That's one of Satsuma's ships. It's carrying raw sugar. We're gonna steal that ship. We'll steal it and its cargo, and we'll get off this island. Change in plans! Let's get out of here! But what about Mugen?! Do you have any last words? Hurry up and get it over with. Going to Hell don't bother me none. Life here is pretty much a living Hell, anyway. But the thought of bein' killed by you bastards rubs me the wrong way. I lived my life without any help from anybody. And if I'm gonna die, I'm gonna send myself to Hell without any help from you. Son of a...! Shoot! Shoot him! The same thing happened back then, too. Mugen was executed by the Satsuma domain officials for the assault on the raw sugar transport. But that was a trap set for him by Mukuro. And so was this time... Mugen's been killed by him twice now. I want to avenge him. Please, kill Mukuro. I take it you know where he is? Mugen... T-There's a-- Mugen! Mugen... You can't be... Why? Why'd you have to die? No way, he's still alive? Mugen...! Hey! Mugen! Got it? You and me are the only ones who know where this hiding place is. We'll leave the gold here until the heat dies down. I'm trusting you on this. Don't go blabbing to Koza just because you have a thing for her. Sounds like you think it was Koza that won me over. What, it wasn't? The reason I signed on was for the money. So all my little plots were for nothing, huh? Oh, I wouldn't go that far. Hey, you people there. May we help you? You know that a government transport ship was attacked here last night, right? Yes. We're looking for leads on the attackers. Did you see or hear anything? Those are strange clothes. Are you from this village? Get over here! We found the ship! What?! Is anybody on board? Is the money safe?! The hold is empty! Where the heck did Jin and Koza go? Mugen's back, but they aren't here... What? I'm starving... Hang on, I'll go scrounge something up. Finally here, huh? Shiren's waiting on pins and needles for you inside. You! How did you know about this place? She wouldn't... I was supposed to be the one who killed him. Draw your weapon! I was such a fool... I was completely fooled... I was, and so were you... Mugen? He couldn't have-- Where the heck did he go?! Geez! You're-- What, you thought I was gonna die before I killed you? I'm gonna go put an end to this. I killed him. What did you say? Mukuro is dead. I killed him. You son of a... We were played for fools. As was he. This is one opponent that I will be unable to kill. Do you think we did the right thing? Of course we did. You wanted to be free of Mukuro, didn't you? And now we have money to burn. Once the heat dies down, I'll show you where it's hidden. You're having second thoughts? There's no other way for me to get by in life. My whole life, this is how I've had to live. Don't abandon me, okay? Don't leave me. Kill me... Please, kill me! Dawn comes, and we part ways once again My dreams becoming distant apparitions I turn to the warm wind for help, the wind I felt every time you held me As I was bathed in the light that followed on your heels Spring is announced when the wild plants break out in a dance Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields are patterns of grass set out to dry The autumn moon rises, let's celebrate its fullness Winter passes by, and I count off the days and months again I can still see the too-distant blue sky when I close my eyes (It was so warm) As I reminisce, I take your hand as I pluck flowers and sing Within the memories that are now coming back to me I'm setting out to find my way back to you Spring is announced when the mountain leaves break out in dance Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with plains grass patterns are set out to dry The autumn moon rises, let's celebrate its fullness Winter passes by, and I count off the days and months again Dawn comes, and we part ways once again My dreams becoming distant apparitions I turn to the warm wind for help, the wind I felt every time you held me As I was bathed in the light that followed on your heels
